Using basic C with Atmel Studio, a “Space Invaders” game was modified to allow push button and keyboard interaction, hit detection, speed variation and scoring on a LED matrix, seven segment display and serial terminal (puTTY). This was submitted as the project for CSSE2010 (Introduction to Computer Systems) in which I also had the opportunity to complete projects focused on logic diagrams, logic gate design and constructing logic circuits using a breadboard.
